I have implemented various cryptographic operations to ensure secure communication between Alice and Bob. Firstly, I generated an RSA key pair for Bob, consisting of a public key and a private key, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data transmission. Using Bob's public key, I encrypted the symmetric cipher key that was used in my previous project (stream/block cipher).k="daddyboughtadonkey"K is essential for encryption and decryption processes, employing RSA encryption techniques. To guarantee the integrity of the message, I designed a hash function to generate a unique message digest (D).D for the given message (X). Finally, I created an RSA digital signature for (D).D used Alice's private key, providing Bob with assurance regarding the authenticity of the message. Through these meticulous cryptographic procedures, I have effectively addressed the task requirements, establishing a robust framework for secure communication between Alice and Bob.If you need more details about these things, please go through the documentation I have attached to my LinkedIn profile under this project.
